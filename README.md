# Real Time Bus Tracker

<img src="Screenshot.jpg" alt="Map of MIT and Boston Common">

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course.

The Real Time Bus Tracker shows the animation of the real route of the Red Line moving from MIT to Boston Common. The program utilizes JavaScript and Mapbox API, along with HTML and CSS, to render and manipulate a map on a webpage. 

Clicking on the button in the top left of the page starts the animation. 

## How To Run

Download index.html, styles.css and mapanimation.js files by clicking the green code button. Make sure to save them to the same directory on your computer. Load the index.html file into your browser. Press the button to see the marker move along the route from MIT to Boston Common.

You can also interact with the page without having to download the files.
